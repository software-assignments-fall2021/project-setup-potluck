# Team Norms and Guidelines:
### Guidelines for Collaboration:

- Regular Meetings will be held to delegate tasks and decide on project direction.
- All meetings should be synchronus and at least hybrid in person/zoom.
- Sprints are two weeks long.
- Regular, short, Standups will be held to check in on progress and provide a platform for asking for help.
 - Subgroup meetings will be held where teamembers working on the same task either work together or help each other.
- Group members have an opportunity to ask for help during either standups or subgroup meetsing.	
- Slack is also a resource that members can message each other.
    - During a regular day, Ideally members should respond within a few hours/by the end of day.
	- During crunch time: within an hour or two maximum.
- In case of a disgreement:
    - Group members will be encouraged to attempt to resolve conflicts amicably by themselves at first.
    - Group discussion until a consensus is reached.
	- Efforts should be made to compromise if that's possible.

### Git Standards:
- Limit 5 new files per pull request.
- Pull Requests must be reviewed by teammembers who are working in the same sub-team (front end/ back end).
- Team members should make a fork and make their clones/branches/commits off of the fork rather than working on the main project.
- Commits should have a short name that describes the change (they should also include a short description in the commit description box if applicable)
- New features should have their own unique branches, if multiple members would otherwise be working on the same branch they should make sub branches.
- Whoever opened up the Pull Requeset should merge after the Pull request is approved. They are also responsible for any conflicts/version updates that arise.
- Team members should notate who assisted/co-authored each commit they push.
- Pull requests must be approved in order to merge. Open source contributors must contact the team in order .

### Coding Standards:
- Team members should try and adhere to the standards when they can.
- Members should comment their code in extreme detail.
- Members should try and and write functions to avoid code re-use
- Members should try and use higher order functions/es6 instead of loops.
- Members should try and make their code as short as possible without compromising readibility.
- Try to use async await instead of promise callbacks.
- Bonus: Unit test cases for critical features.

### Setup:
- Clone repository
- Create new branch/checkout branch
- Type in "npm install" to download node modules from package.json
- Resolve npm depenency conflicts
